# tetris-clone

A Simple Tetris-Clone built to explore gesture control in React Native. To use you'll need Expo installed on your machine.

Fork and clone, run ```npm i``` then ```expo start```. Does not work in web view at the moment, needs to be run on a mobile device using expo.

Built purely for educational purposes.
